O church arise and put your armour on
  
Hear the call of Christ ourCaptain
  
For now the weak can say that they are strong
  
In the strength that God has given
  
With shield of faith and belt of truth
  
We’ll stand against the devil’s lies
  
An army bold whose battle-cry is Love
  
Reaching out to those in darkness

Our call to war to love the captive soul
  
But to rage against the captor
  
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole
  
We will fight with faith and valour
  
When faced with trials on every side
  
We know the outcome is secure
  
And Christ will have the prize for which He died
  
An inheritance of nations

Come see the cross where love and mercy meet
  
As the Son of God is stricken
  
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet
  
For the Conqueror has risen
  
And as the stone is rolled away
  
And Christ emerges from the grave
  
This victory march continues till the day
  
Every eye and heart shall see Him

So Spirit come put strength in every stride
  
Give grace for every hurdle
  
That we may run with faith to win the prize
  
Of a servant good and faithful
  
As saints of old still line the way
  
Retelling triumphs of His grace
  
We hear their calls and hunger for the day
  
When with Christ we stand in glory
  
教会兴起，披戴全副盔甲，
  
闻主王角声传来；
  
弱者已变斗士，
  
神赐能力满怀；
  
信德当藤牌，真理作腰带，
  
我等全力抵挡魔鬼之诡计；
  
众军高唱神圣之爱，
  
呼唤死荫中人醒来。

蒙召征战，施被囚灵魂以慈怜，
  
却报掳掠者以怒颜；
  
挥舞医人之宝剑，
  
凭信心英勇作战；
  
哪怕四围艰险，
  
我众必定凯旋；
  
基督舍命赢得冠冕，
  
万国万民为其业产。

来看此十架，其上爱怜交加，
  
全因神子惨遭击打；
  
再看彼仇敌，被神踏于脚下，
  
皆因基督复活蒙嘉；
  
石头已被滚开，
  
基督墓门出跨；
  
一路凯歌直至那日，
  
万众瞩目朝见于他。

圣灵请来！赐力量于每战争，
  
施恩典于每困境；
  
使吾辈凭信奔途赢赏，
  
做恩主忠心良善仆从；
  
旧日圣徒如云环绕，
  
述说基督恩典得胜；
  
我众听闻先贤呼求，
  
祈盼那日与主同荣。
